                  The Wire Image of a Network Protocol
                    draft-trammell-wire-image-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the wire image, an abstraction of the
   information available to an on-path non-participant in a networking
   protocol.  This abstraction is intended to shed light on current
   discussions within the IETF on the implications on increased
   encryption has for network functions that use the wire image.

Internet-Draft                 Wire Image                  November 2017


1.  Introduction

   A protocol specification defines a set of behaviors for each
   participant in the protocol: which lower-layer protocols are used for
   which services, how messages are formatted and protected, which
   participant sends which message when, how each participant should
   respond to each message, and so on.

   Implicit in a protocol specification is the information the protocol
   radiates toward nonparticipant observers of the messages sent among
   participants.  Any information that has a clear definition in the
   protocol's message format(s), or is implied by that definition, and
   is not cryptographically confidentiality-protected can be
   unambiguously interpreted by those observers.

   This information comprises the protocol's wire image, which we define
   and discuss in this document.  It is the wire image, not the
   protocol's specification, that determines how third parties on the
   network paths among protocol participants will interact with that
   protocol.

   Several documents currently under discussion in IETF working groups
   and the IETF in general, for example [QUIC-MANAGEABILITY],
   [EFFECT-ENCRYPT], and [TRANSPORT-ENCRYPT], discuss in part impacts on
   the third-party use of wire images caused by a migration from
   protocols whose wire images are largely not confidentiality protected
   (e.g.  HTTP over TCP) to protocols whose wire images are
   confidentiality protected (e.g.  H2 over QUIC).

   This document presents the wire image abstraction with the hope that
   it can shed some light on these discussions.

2.  Definition

   More formally, the wire image of a protocol consists of the sequence
   of messages sent by each participant in the protocol, each expressed
   as a sequence of bits with an associated arbitrary-precision time at
   which it was sent.

3.  Discussion

   This definition is so vague as to be difficult to apply to protocol
   analysis, but it does illustrate some important properties of the
   wire image:

   o  The wire image is not limited to merely "the unencrypted bits in
      the header".  In particular, timing, size, and sequence
      information can be used to infer other parameters of the behavior

      of the protocol, or to fingerprint protocols and/or specific
      implmentations of the protocol.

   o  The wire image is multidimensional.  This implies that the name
      "image" is not merely metaphorical, and that general image
      recognition techniques can be applied to extracting paterns and
      information from it.

3.1.  Obscuring timing and sizing information

   Cryptography can protect the confidentiality of a protocol's headers,
   to the extent that forwarding devices do not need the
   confidentiality-protected information for basic forwarding
   operations.  However, it cannot be applied to protecting non-header
   information in the wire image.  Of particular interest is the
   sequence of packet sizes and the sequence of packet times.  These are
   characteristic of the operation of the protocol.  A sender may use
   padding to increase the size of packets, and inject delay into
   sending in order to increase delay components, however it does this
   as the expense of bandwidth efficiency and latency.  This technique
   is therefore limited to the tolerance for inefficiency and latency of
   the application.

3.2.  Integrity Protection of the Wire Image

   Portions of the wire image of a protocol that are neither
   confidentiality-protected nor integrity-protected are writable by
   devices on a path.  A protocol with a wire image that is largely
   writable operating over a path with devices that understand the
   semantics of the protocol's wire image can modify it, in order to
   induce behaviors at the protocol's participants.  This is the case
   with TCP in the modern Internet.

   Adding end-to-end integrity protection to portions of the wire image
   makes it impossible for on-path devices to modify them without
   detection by the endpoints, which can then take action in response to
   those modifications, making these portions of the wire image
   effectively immutable.

   Note that a protocol's wire image cannot be made completely immutable
   in a packet-switched network.  The observed delay sequence is
   modified as packets move through the network and experience different
   delays on different links, and packets may be dropped at any time, as
   a consequence of the network's operation.  Intermediate systems with
   knowledge of the protocol semantics in the readable portion of the
   wire image can also purposely delay or drop packets in order to
   affect the protocol's operation.

3.3.  Engineering the Wire Image

   We note that understanding the nature of a protocol's wire image
   allows it to be engineered.  The general principle at work here,
   observed through experience with deployability and non-deployability
   of protocols at the network and transport layers in the Internet, is
   that all observable parts of a protocol's wire image will eventually
   ossify, and become difficult or impossible to change in future
   extensions or revisions of the protocol.

   A network function which serves a purpose useful to its deployer will
   use the information it needs from the wire image, and will tend to
   get that information from the wire image in the simplest way
   possible.  A protocol's wire image should therefore be designed to
   explicitly expose information to those network functions in an
   obvious way, and to expose as little other information as possible.

   However, even when information is explicitly provided to the network,
   any information that is exposed by the wire image, even that
   informaiton not intended to be consumed by an observer, must be
   designed carefully as it might ossify, making it immutable for future
   versions of the protocol.  For example, information needed to support
   decryption by the receiving endpoint (cryptographic handshakes,
   sequence numbers, and so on) may be used by the path for its own
   purposes.
